# Hugo Mitsumori

- I choose Ruby as the language for the solution because of its good readability and fastness to writting
As the problem isn't performance heavy, I thought there was no need for a high performance language as C

- Ruby version used was 2.4.1

- Need to install minitest gem for automated tests:

	gem install minitest

- Test cases are in the solution file (solver,rb), and can be run as a common ruby program:

	ruby solver.rb
